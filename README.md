## Data Source
Our dataset was taken from a Kaggle dataset with 70,000 plus data points that was uploaded a little less than two years ago. It contains thirteen columns (12 feature columns and the outcome column, cardio).  The original uploader is a researcher named Svetlana Ulianova.

## Summary of the Project
The research topic we chose was an exploration of cardiovascular disease, and the factors (features) that can lead to its occurrence.

Heart disease is a serious world issue that affects every country to a varying degree. We hope after performing this analysis we will have a better understanding (at least on a personal level) of what leads to these dreadful conditions and what measures may be taken in order to try to stop them.

The dataset used contains data for cardiovascular disease patients. The data in the file used contains information on a patient’s age, gender, height, weight, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, BMI, whether they smoked, used alcohol, or their level of physical activity. These metrics all play a deciding factor in whether a person develops cardiovascular disease. There were no potential outliers found in the dataset, also no metric involved has been proven to any other statistically. Any missing values were removed to prevent errors in results.

With the use of machine learning models, the future of medicine could very well be far more preventive than reactive.  This would mean not only a dramatic increase in the ability to save lives before they’re at risk, but also reduce the enormous financial burdens that cardiovascular disease brings with it.
